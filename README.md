# Inefficient MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline

This repository contains a demonstration of an inefficient MongoDB aggregation pipeline and its optimized solution.

The original pipeline suffers from performance issues when dealing with large datasets. The improved version addresses these issues by incorporating efficient techniques such as indexing and error handling.

## Original Pipeline

The `bug.js` file showcases an inefficient MongoDB aggregation pipeline. This pipeline performs a match, group, sort, and limit operation without leveraging indexes, potentially leading to slow query performance for large datasets.  There is also no error handling to detect if the aggregation stage fails and the aggregation pipeline might not handle edge cases resulting in unexpected behavior.

## Optimized Pipeline

The `bugSolution.js` file provides an improved version of the aggregation pipeline. It addresses the performance and error handling issues present in the original pipeline by:

* Creating an index on the field used in the `$match` stage to speed up the query process. 
* Adding error handling to gracefully manage failures in any stage of the aggregation pipeline. 
* Refactoring the pipeline for better clarity and maintainability.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a MongoDB collection with a sizable dataset.
3. Run the `bug.js` script to see the performance issue.
4. Run the `bugSolution.js` script to see the improvements.
